# üì¶ GraphQL Binary Installer via Ansible

This Ansible playbook automates the process of:

1. Connecting to a GraphQL endpoint (`apple.com`)
2. Sending an authenticated GraphQL POST request
3. Downloading a ZIP package from the response
4. Extracting the package
5. Running an installation script (`install.sh`) from the extracted directory

## üßæ Prerequisites

- Ansible installed on the control machine
- Target machine has:
  - `curl`, `unzip`, `bash` installed

Update the following variables in the playbook:

| Variable        | Description                                    |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------|
| `gql_url`       | The GraphQL API endpoint                      |
| `auth_token`    | Bearer token for authentication               |
| `query`         | GraphQL query to get the download link        |
